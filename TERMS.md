Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.

The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.

The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your account and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises using strong, unique passwords and enabling any available security features. You should also keep your browser up to date and be cautious of phishing attempts. Sharing your account credentials or API keys with others may compromise your security and may result in unauthorized access to your data.

Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of internet access or connectivity issues.

The Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the Application. It is your responsibility to ensure you have a stable internet connection when using the Service.

In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the application.

The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you.
